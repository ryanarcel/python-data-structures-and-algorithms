Python Data Structures and Algorithms

Hi fellas,

   Ryan here, I have been teaching programming courses for quite a while now and I have found out that the subject of Data Structures and Algorithms is probably the trickiest subject to master for any learner. I created this repository of all my data sets and sample problems in regards to Data Structures and Algorithms. May this help anybody who has a difficulty in terms of understanding different Data Structures and how they operate, as well as coming up with different algorithms to solve complex programming problems. Enjoy!
